                <p>
                            Throughout the course of the day I was very happy that I waked up healthy and I could see another beautiful day. I spent time with my family and friends. I went out to the restaurant with my brother and my two little sisters.
                    The best part is I went to Canada for vacation and spent time with my childhood friends. I got good raise at my work. I was also happy I got the chance to do my workout as I wanted.
                    I push myself to the to the point I have no limits or beyond. I work out very hard because it is something I love and admire to do. I love the feeling After the workout is what made me feel very good, the muscle soreness is thrilling or exciting. 
                </p>
                    
                    <p>                    
                    During the day, I was not happy because I didn't get a chance to ice skating with my friends. The reason why is that one of my friends take too long to get ready or dress up.
                    Therefore, by the time he was ready it was about 7:30 p.m. and driving to 42nd Bryant Park would take about half an hour and by the time we get there all skating park would be closed because they close at 10 p.m. So, if we took a half an hour driving there, there was no guarantee that we would get a parking without spending a half an hour looking for one. After we would only would have 1 hour and 30 minutes to skate, which was not enough time to enjoy the skating oval so we chose not to go. Another thing that get me so mad during the day. I went to the school to pay for my parking permit for the spring and they lady told me that I can’t because I own the school $2000. I went to the financial aid they told me they can’t pay for my classes and I must pay that balance to be able to pay for parking permit. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Sprinting back from the unhappy moment was the easiest part because my friends and I bought food and went back to the car listen to music meanwhile making joke at each other while eating and by 10 p.m. I had already forgotten about ice skating plan.
                    This is the reasons why is always to surround yourself with positive people that don’t take life with granted because sometime they will help us relief our negative emotions.
                    Hoverer, I am not person who take thing like it is end of the world because I always balance myself and express my feeling. I believe everything happen for a reason and I can’t change god plans.
